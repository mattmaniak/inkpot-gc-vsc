# Inkpot GC VSC

## Description
Gynvael Coldwind's inkpot_gc theme for GVim/Sublime ported to the VS Code. This is only a theme, not full config. Based on screenshots from his stream. Some colors were taken directly from inkpot_gc.vim, others from YouTube screenshots, some from my initial interpretation called [Inkpot GC GTK](https://github.com/mattmaniak/inkpot_gc_gtk). Some may be a little vary in comparison to GVim/Sublime original due the optimization for the VS Code.
